# Dockerized PHP 7.4 with Apache

This Dockerfile sets up a PHP 7.4 environment with Apache, suitable for local development.
You can find the pre-built Docker image on Docker Hub at [jbeat/apache-php](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jbeat/apache-php/general).

## Usage

1. **Pull the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker pull jbeat/apache-php:7.4.0
    ```

2. **Selective type docker-compose.yaml:**

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
    webserver:
    image: jbeat/apache-php:7.4.0
    container_name: container-name
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ".:/var/www/html"
   ```

     ```bash
      docker-compose up -d --build
     ```

3. **Selective type Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
    docker run -d --name [container-name] -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/var/www/html jbeat/apache-php:7.4.0
   ```

   Replace `[container-name]` with a desired name for your container and
   `8080` with the desired host port. The `-v` option mounts the current
   directory (`$(pwd)`) to the container's `/var/www/html` directory,
   allowing you to easily sync your local code with the container.


4. **Access the PHP application:**

   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or the port you specified).
